They are pronounced in the same way but have quite different meanings: as a verb, complement means ‘add to something in a way that enhances or improves,’ as in a classic blazer complements a look that's smart or casual, while compliment means ‘admire and praise someone for something,’ as in he complimented her on her appearance. Complementary means ‘forming a complement or addition, completing,’ as in I purchased a suit with a complementary tie. This is often confused with complimentary, for which one sense is ‘given freely, as a courtesy’: honeymooners receive complimentary fruit and flowers",

They are pronounced in the same way but have quite different meanings: as a verb, complement means ‘add to something in a way that enhances or improves,’ as in a classic blazer complements a look that's smart or casual, while compliment means ‘admire and praise someone for something,’ as in he complimented her on her appearance. Complementary means ‘forming a complement or addition, completing,’ as in I purchased a suit with a complementary tie. This is often confused with complimentary, for which one sense is ‘given freely, as a courtesy’: honeymooners receive complimentary fruit and flowers",
